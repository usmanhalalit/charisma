Overview
--------

Shadowbox is a flexible media viewer that supports all of the web's most popular
media publishing formats. Shadowbox is written entirely in JavaScript and CSS and
is highly customizable. Using Shadowbox, website authors can display a wide
assortment of media in all major browsers without navigating users away from the
linking page.

Installation and Usage
----------------------

For detailed installation and usage instructions, please see the usage page at
http://shadowbox-js.com/usage.html.

How to Build
------------

IMPORTANT: The following instructions are for those who would like to create a custom build
of Shadowbox on their own machines. Most users will not want to do this and instead should
simply download, install, and use Shadowbox as described on the Shadowbox website at
http://shadowbox-js.com/usage.html.

In order to build Shadowbox on your own machine you must have the Ruby programming
language (http://ruby-lang.org/) installed as well as the Rake build tool
(http://rake.rubyforge.org/). Simply edit the parameters in `build.yml` to your liking
and run the following command from the project root directory:

    $ rake

Note: If you want to build a compressed version of the code (which is the default), you
will also need Java installed. You can always use the web interface on the Shadowbox website
(http://shadowbox-js.com/download.html) to build your own version of the code if you are
unable to do it on your own.

How to Run Tests and Examples
-----------------------------

The Shadowbox test suite is written with QUnit (http://github.com/jquery/qunit). To run the
tests, you first need to build the code using the `build:tests` Rake task.

    $ rake build:tests

Once you have built the code, open `tests/index.html` in your browser of choice. Likewise,
to run any of the examples you first need to run the `build:examples` Rake task before
opening the example HTML file in your browser.

    $ rake build:examples
